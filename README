The second "project". The worst online mobile phone store.

This app is deployed on GitHub Pages (https://roman178.github.io/second_the-worst-online-mobile-phone-store/)

Simplest server for this app written by Express.js deployed on Heroku.
You can find your fake orders on https://tranquil-shelf-04975.herokuapp.com/orders.
At least once a day Heroku stops the app-server, so that images for this client app are not be render.
Just come back later.
